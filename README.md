# Liri Bot

Liri is a robot that helps you get information about movies, songs and concerts. Liri uses Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs to provide you with all the info you need!

## Getting Started

Liri can be run using the command line. Once you have node installed, navigate to the directory containing liri.js file. You can access the various features following the examples below:
- node liri.js concert-this kygo
- node liri.js movie-this titanic
- node liri.js spotify-this-song hello
- node liri.js do-what-it-says
    - In the last case, liri reads the random.txt file and then executes one of the other three commands

The liri-images folder contains example outputs for each of the commands.
